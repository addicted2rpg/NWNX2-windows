This really has no "official documentation" that is packaged with it that I could find beyond Virusman's original 2012 
statements found in old-readme.txt which were released in one of his pre-versions of the plugin.  

Here are some community resources that talk about it a little as well:


From neverwinternights.info/nwnx2.htm:

"When running on the server, any player connecting with NWNCX can select PW-specific options during character 
creation (such as base classes, spells, and feats). The game client pre-loads the PW's haks.
- Created by virusman, 2012."

Subject: 	NWNX Connect 

hi, I saw your recent posts with memory fixes and chat plugin

could you look into the win versions of Connect that I did? It crashes on Win 7 and I am unable to fix it, 
maybe its because the same issue as in chat? It randomly crashes after using CNWMessage__WriteCExoString when passes 
not null string and I am really clueless how to fix it.

Any help will be appreciated, thanks. Shadooow



^^^ oh yeah, we learned the hard way CNWMessage__WriteCexoString is/was horribly broke  :)  (or at least on Win7).
^^^ solution: used assembler ;-)  Whatever is wrong with it, it is non-obvious.

NWNCX allows you to use custom content (skills, feats, etc.) on character creation, but it does not unlock custom 
base classes yet.
